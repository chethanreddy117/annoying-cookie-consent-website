🌟 **Introducing: The Annoying Cookie Consent Website!** 🍪

Ever felt like cookie consent pop-ups are the modern-day equivalent of door-to-door salespeople? Well, I took that frustration and turned it into a fun project! 

In this quirky website, users are greeted by a cheeky cookie consent modal that not only asks for their name and email but also adds a dash of humor to the mix. Imagine a "Decline" button that plays hard to get—every time you hover over it, it decides to shimmy away in a random direction. Who knew consent could be this entertaining?

### Here’s what I packed into this delightful annoyance:
- A playful cookie consent modal that’s impossible to ignore (because let’s face it, they usually are).
- Smooth animations that make the experience feel a bit less like a chore and a bit more like a game.
- A blurred background effect that keeps your focus right where I want it: on the pop-up!
- And yes, a loading animation that jokingly claims your data is being whisked away to the dark web. 😈

### Tech Highlights:
- **JavaScript**: Mastered event listeners and DOM manipulation to keep things lively.
- **CSS**: Employed transitions and transforms to give that button a real workout.
- **HTML**: Structured the page to ensure everything looks sharp and functions well.

This project not only showcases my coding skills but also highlights how we can inject a little humor into serious topics like data consent. Because why not make something annoying a bit more fun?
